maat-scripts
============

Scripts used to post-process the results from Code Maat.

These scripts are referenced from my book [Your Code as a Crime Scene](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/).

The scripts are intended for teaching purposes, and represent a good way to get started and explore the fascinating world of behavioral code analysis. If you came looking for production quality visualizations and tools, then make sure to check out [CodeScene](https://codescene.com/) and its free [Community Edition](https://codescene.com/community-edition).

## Python 3

All scripts have been ported to Python 3 and are available on the [python3](https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts/tree/python3) branch.

## Python 2

The [master](https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts/tree/master) branch still contains the original scripts, compatible with Python 2.7. In the future, I hope to deprecate that support but need to keep it for as long as the 1st edition of the book is around.
